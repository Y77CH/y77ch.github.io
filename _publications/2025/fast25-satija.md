  We present Cloudscape, a dataset of nearly 400 cloud architectures deployed on AWS. We perform an in-depth analysis of the usage of storage services in cloud systems. Our findings include: S3 is the most prevalent storage service (68%), while file system services are rare (4%); heterogeneity is common in the storage layer; storage services primarily interface with Lambda and EC2, while also serving as the foundation for more specialized ML and analytics services. Our findings provide a concrete understanding of how storage services are deployed in real-world cloud architectures, and our analysis of the popularity of different services grounds existing research.
